- A **tree** is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path, or equivalently a connected acyclic undirected graph.
- A **binary tree** is a tree in which each node has up to two children.
- A **complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which every level of the tree is fully filled, except for perhaps the
last level. To the extent that the last level is filled, it is filled left to right.
- A **full binary tree** is a binary tree in which every node has either zero or two children.
- A **perfect binary tree** is one that is both full and complete. All leaf nodes will be at the same level, and this
level has the maximum number of nodes.
- A **binary search tree** is a binary tree in which every node fits a specific ordering property: all left
descendents <= n < all right descendents.
- A **min-heap** is a complete binary tree where each node is smaller than its children.
